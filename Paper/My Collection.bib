abstract = {Time-resolved two-photon photoemission (2PPE) at various photon energies is used to investigate the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Cu(111), applying auto- and cross-correlation techniques. The relaxation times vary from 250 fs at 0.1 eV above the Fermi level to 20 fs at 2 eV and show a strong wavelength dependence in the vicinity of the (Formula presented)-band feature in the 2PPE spectra. Electrons not directly excited from the (Formula presented) band exhibit a much longer relaxation time than (Formula presented)-band electrons excited to the same intermediate-state energy. We attribute these apparently longer lifetimes to a delayed electron generation via Auger decay of (Formula presented)-band holes. Based on a band structure calculation, a simulation of the ballistic transport effect and its implication on the observed electron relaxation dynamics is presented for the three low-index copper surfaces. These observations suggest that (Formula presented)-band holes have a substantially longer lifetime than excited (Formula presented)-band electrons of the corresponding excitation energy. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},
