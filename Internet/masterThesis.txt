\section{OpenQuestions}

E\textsubscript{\textit F}

\section{Introduction}
The aim of this work is to broaden the understanding of electron and hole dynamics in heterostructures, by using the modelsystem \gls{fe}-\gls{au}. The novelty of this work is using \gls{LPE},in both the \gls{FP} geometry to Probe on the \gls{au} surface,as well as the \gls{BP} geometry analyzing the transport dynamics by exciting the electrons in the \gls{fe} and probing them in the \gls{au}. By varying the thickness this work will attempt to disentangle the effects from the different constituents.

\section{Theoretical Background}
    \subsection{Optical Penetration Depth}
\cite{Weaver}
    \subsection{Linear Photoemission}
	There are two different mayor types of Photoemission, the process of exciting an electron over the vacuum energy using photons, \gls{2PPE} and \gls{LPE} both use two photon excitation. In \gls{2PPE} the energy of each photon is lower than the workfunction of the material, which needs to be exceeded to detach an electron from the material. So in 2PPE an electron only leaves the material if one photon beam raises the electron into an excited state and the second photon again excites the elevated electron to a state above the vacuum energy. See figure 1 (left). This method leads to a good \gls{S/N}, but it has a limited measurable range and acts complementary to the used \gls{LPE}.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\center{\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]
		{figures/Energy2PPEvsARPES.pdf}}
		\caption{Depiction of the \gls{2PPE} (left) and \gls{LPE} (right).}
		\label{2PPEvsARPES}
	\end{figure}
	The figure depicts the difference, between \gls{2PPE} and \gls{LPE} on a gold surface, indicated by the workfunction \textTheta = 5.3\,eV, the hatched areas depict the probed regions of the exicted states. The clear advantage of \gls{LPE} is the ability to probe right up and even below the \gls{EF}.
	For \gls{LPE} the Probe photons, here a $6\,\mathrm{\mbox{eV}}$ beam, already has a photon energy higher than the workfunction of the probed material. This means the Probe can access all electrons above the \gls{EF} and part of the electrons below the \gls{EF}.%\\
	\begin{equation}
	E_{ below \,\, E\textsubscript{\textit F} } = E_{ Probe } -\Theta
	\end{equation}
	With \textTheta \,\,being the workfunction of the material and E\textsubscript{Probe} the used photonenergy of the probe beam, giving us the observable range below the \gls{EF}. By varying the probe energy one can look into lower lying ground states, or by varying the pump energy gain access to a different area of the unoccupied states. Since \gls{LPE} probes below the \gls{EF} the excitation by the pump beam even reveals hole states and they decaying dynamics. 
	\subsection{Elementary Scattering Processes}
	The next chapter will not cover all possible electron scattering processes, but give an overview of the important mechanism playing a role in the dynamics this work is observing.
	After excitation electrons start moving away from their initial position, because of a gradient in the electron state distribution and separate scattering processes on different timescales will dissipate the energy in the system. Here we focus on the dynamics that take place within the first picosecond.\cite{Bovensiepen2012} 
		\begin{figure}[H]
		\center{\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]
		{figures/Timescale.png}}
		\caption{The typical timescales of electron dynamics.\cite{Bauer2015}}
		\label{timescale}
	\end{figure}
	In Fig.\ref{timescale} the timescales of the excitation dynamics are shown, first the nearby electrons screen the charge of the formed hole state, this is the reason why direct radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs becomes very unlikely. Next the electrons lose phase coherence and start to scatter. These \gls{ee} almost exclusively occur with 'cold' electrons below \gls{EF}, generating new, so called, secondary electrons. Then after a few hundred femtoseconds and longer, the electrons start scattering with the lattice phonons transferring the energy from the electronic system into the lattice. During all these processes the electrons can propagate through the metal, see \ref{Electrontransportchapter} \cite{Bauer2015}
	\subsubsection{Electron-Electron Interactions}
	The first e-e interaction is the screening of the induced charges. The electrons have Coulomb forces between each other, which can  be seen as an average field that an electron experiences. If now an electron gets excited into a higher state, the leftover hole gets screened by the cloud of electrons available to spread over this emerging Coulomb source \cite{ziman2001electrons}. This screening occurs on the order of attoseconds \cite{Bovensiepen2012}. After the screening the electrons start losing coherence.\textbf{Les dir das nochmal genauer durch und frag nach\cite{decoherence}}. \cite{ziman2001electrons}

	\subsubsection{Electron-Defect Interactions}
	\subsection{Electrontransport}
    \label{Electrontransportchapter}
        \subsubsection{Diffusive Regime}
	    \subsubsection{Super-diffusive Regime}
	    \subsubsection{Ballistic Transport}
	\subsection{Model System}
	As a Model system to study the effects of electron transport, a \gls{fe}-\gls{au} hetero structure on \gls{MGO} was chosen. The \gls{MGO} substrate provides a 001-crystal surface ideal for epitaxial growth, which is important for clean interfaces to let us neglect interface scattering. Furthermore \gls{MGO} has good transmittance of the $800\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ Pump-beam. The first layer on the \gls{MGO} is a $7\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ thick, epitaxially grown, \gls{fe} film above which there is a second layer.  The \gls{fe}, due to its good absorption in the visible range, acts in back pump as an injection layer, laserabsorption profiles will later show that most of the energy of the pump beam in the back pump configuration is absorbed in the \gls{fe} layer. Then the exited electrons get injected, into the second layer, a \gls{au} film of varying thickness, in which the electrons propagate to the vacuum surface, where they get extracted by the probe beam. In case of front side excitation, we excite directly on the probed surface and can study the influence of \gls{fe} as a trap for the electrons by changing the thickness of the \gls{au} layer.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection{Vacuum Chamber}
The Vacuum chamber can be split into three selfcontained chambers, each with an independent vacuum system. The magazine for loading and unloading, the upper, for sample preparation, and the lower chamber, for experimentation. They all run at pressures of $10\textsuperscript{-10}\,\mathrm{mbar}$.


\subsubsection{Magazine and Loadlock}
The magazine and loadlock can be used to quickly change samples and keep up to six samples in UHV-conditions.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\center{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
		{figures/Magazine.pdf}}
		\caption{constructional drawing of the magazine and \gls{ll}  source:U.Bovensiepen}
		\label{magazin}
	\end{figure}
Fig.\ref{magazin} shows a sketch of the magazine and loadlock. The Magazine is connected to the loadlock and the upper chamber by gate valves(5). The Magazine can be pulled out by a rod(4) to allow the manipulator(3) to pass samples from the magazine into the upper chamber. The loadlock has a flange door(1) to allow insertion of new sample, while the gate valve(5) keeps the magazine vacuum up. To vent the loadlock, there is a small rubber valve(2) in the back. The loadlock and magazine run on their own turbo-pump with a separate membrane pre pump, they can still be attached to pumps of the main chamber to ensure vacuum, in case of a failure, for prepared samples. There is an ion gauge installed in the magazine to monitor the pressure.

\subsubsection{Upper chamber}
The upper chamber is used to change samples, prepare them for experiments and do some sample characterization.
The upper chamber is run by a turbo-pump coupled to a membrane pump.  
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\center{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
		{figures/upperchamber.pdf}}
		\caption{constructional drawing of the upper chamber source:U.Bovensiepen}
		\label{upper}
	\end{figure}


\subsection{Laser Setup}
The laser system consists of a Verdi V18 Solid-State-Laser which pumps a Ti:Sa femtosecond Laser (Coherent \textit{Micra} 900-B) and a regenerative amplifier (Coherent \textit{RegA} 9040). 13 Watts of the Verdi V18 laser are used to pump the regenerative amplifier, while the remaining 5 Watts are used to power the \textit{Micra oscillator}. \textbf{Ask Ping how the strecher compressor incoupling works with the RegA} A laserbeam of $1.1\,\mathrm{\mbox{W}}$ with a center wavelength of \textlambda $ = 800\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ and a spectral width of \textDelta \textlambda $ = 31.40\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ is generated.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\center{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
		{figures/LasersetupVortrag.pdf}}
		\caption{a schematic view of the femtosecond lasersetup}
		\label{Lasersetup}
	\end{figure}
	
The \textlambda $ =  800\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ or $1.55\,\mathrm{\mbox{eV}}$ beam is split into two parts, a fraction for the pump-pulse and the rest to generate the UV probe pulse via two times \gls{SHG}.
\subsubsection{Beam path}
\textbf{Make a sketch of the beampath for alignment}
To realise a pump-probe scheme in \gls{LPE} the pump and the probe pulse need to line up both spatially and temporally. To get a rough overlap of the beams they are both redirected through a  pin hole, at the exact same distance
as the sample behind which there is a luminescent paper to see the beams. By moving the $1.55\,\mathrm{\mbox{eV}}$ only with the flip mirror and the $6\,\mathrm{\mbox{eV}}$ with 
\subsection{Oscillator}
\subsection{Discriminator}
\subsection{CCD-camera/Beamprofile}

\subsection{Bias-Series}
\subsection{Delay-Line-Setup}
For the spatial overlap, a Pinhole and a \gls{CCD}-Camera is used. But to gain the temporal overlap of the two laserpulses we use a delayline.

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Calculation of Laser Absorption Profile}
For the calculation of the absorption profile of the laser the programm xop \cite{Laserprog} was used to calculate the absorption depth of the $800\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ and $200\,\mathrm{\mbox{nm}}$ lasers.
