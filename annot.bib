abstract = {Time-resolved two-photon photoemission (2PPE) at various photon energies is used to investigate the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Cu(111), applying auto- and cross-correlation techniques. The relaxation times vary from 250 fs at 0.1 eV above the Fermi level to 20 fs at 2 eV and show a strong wavelength dependence in the vicinity of the (Formula presented)-band feature in the 2PPE spectra. Electrons not directly excited from the (Formula presented) band exhibit a much longer relaxation time than (Formula presented)-band electrons excited to the same intermediate-state energy. We attribute these apparently longer lifetimes to a delayed electron generation via Auger decay of (Formula presented)-band holes. Based on a band structure calculation, a simulation of the ballistic transport effect and its implication on the observed electron relaxation dynamics is presented for the three low-index copper surfaces. These observations suggest that (Formula presented)-band holes have a substantially longer lifetime than excited (Formula presented)-band electrons of the corresponding excitation energy. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This work investigates the ultrafast electron dynamics in low-dimensional materials using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission techniques. In lowdimensional materials, the electronic wave functions are con ned to one and two dimensions, (1D) and (2D). This electron con nement can lead to (i) quantum size e ects, where the physical properties of a solid state material depend decisively on the size of the considered system, and to (ii) many-body phenomena, where electronelectron correlation and coupling to other excitations such as phonons can result in the formation of broken-symmetry ground states like charge density wave (CDW) or superconducting phases. Besides the fundamental scienti c signi cance, low-dimensional materials become increasingly important with the advent of nanotechnology. In this work, several well-de ned prototypical quasi-2D and quasi-1D model systems have been studied. The quantized band structure and electron dynamics of the occupied and unoccupied quantum well states (QWSs) in the quasi-2D model system Pb/Si(111) have been investigated with two-photon photoemission (2PPE) and photoemission spectroscopy (PES) directly in the time domain. The general trend of the hot electron lifetimes in the unoccupied QWS is con rmed to be governed by Fermi liquid theory. To describe all observed population decays quantitatively, the quantized electronic system has to be taken into account since the simultaneous population decay and build-up in two adjacent QWSs favors inter-subband scattering from the higher lying into the lower lying state. The investigation of the dynamics of the highest oc- cupied QWS in Pb/Si(111) with time-resolved PES revealed an ultrafast electronic stabilization due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs that induce a sudden change of the screening of the ion cores and displacively excite a coherent phonon mode in the lm direction. Potential anisotropies of the hot electron lifetimes of self-assembling metallic quasi-1D nanowires in 41-In/Si(111) were investigated using time-resolved 2PPE and a novel position-sensitive electron time-of- ight technique, which was developed as part of this work for ecient angle-resolved photoemission studies of lowdimensional materials with anisotropic band structure. Finally, collective excitations of the electron and lattice system in the prototypical quasi-1D CDWcompound TbTe3 have been explored with time- and angle-resolved PES. The temperature-, uenceand k-dependence of the transient band structure in the CDW nesting region at the Fermi level reveals an oscillation of the valence band, which is assigned to the excitation of the amplitude mode of the CDW phase of TbTe3. At the highest uences investigated, the charge-ordered CDW melts within 100 fs, evidenced by the ultrafast closing of the CDW gap in the band structure at the Fermi level and the transient recurrence of a nearly free electron dispersion.},

abstract = {Complex materials, in which electron correlations play a key role in favoring a rich interplay among the various microscopical electronic, structural and magnetic de- grees of freedom, are of deep scientific and technological interest as they often lead to the appearance of novel, exotic phases. One promising approach to investigate this complex interplay is the study of non-equilibrium states and their relaxation in the time domain, since signatures of different coupling channels can result on distinguishable femto- to picosecond timescales. In the present work the ultrafast electron dynamics of two complex, chemically doped model systems are investigated by means of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) on femtosecond timescales directly in the time-domain. Co-doped BaFe2As2 belongs to the family of the newly discovered Fe-based high-Tc superconductors and understanding the microscopic origins of electronic phases in such materials is important for elucidating the mechanism of high-Tc superconduc- tivity. The ultrafast relaxation of the excited hot electron populations was investi- gated for systems with three different Co-contents and above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. The major findings is the signature of the coupling of the electronic system to a bosonic excitation that manifests itself in a fluence-dependent step occurring in the relaxation rates at the same energy of E−EF = 200meV for all dopings. Due to the energetic position of such a feature and after comparison with neutron scattering experiments in literature, the magnetic origin of such a boson was suggested. A systematic temperature- and fluence-dependent study was performed on 1T-TaS2, in which simultaneously strong electron-electron (e-e) and electron phonon (e-ph) interaction are present, aiming at the characterization of the photoinduced state. The major finding is the observation of a transient population of doubly occupied states in the Mott-insulating phase, that is, the upper Hubbard band (UHB). From the analysis of its temporal evolution, the relevant timescales for photo-induced disorder and the subsequent dynamics in the electronic subsystem could be esti- mated to be of the order of the hopping cycle. While electron-phonon coupling plays a significant role and serve as an energetic loss channel for the excited elec- tronic system on longer time scales, the dynamics, thermalization of carriers in the UHB and subsequent decay of its occupation do not require such coupling. It was concluded that the electronic and phononic subsystem are decoupled at early times after photo perturbation, which lead to a consistent reduction of complexity in the theoretical modelling. Finally a first photoemission experiment aiming at reaching the metastable hidden state and investigating its properties looking directly at both static and dynamical changes in the electronic structure is reported. For both model systems, the time domain approach was crucial to unveil physical properties that wouldn't have been accessible under equilibrium conditions.},

The electronic calculations of MgO mono-layer show a more interesting behavior than its bulk phase such as decreasing the band gap from 7.8 eV to 3.1 eV (for GGA) and 4.2 eV (for GGA-mBJ). Also, the MgO mono-layer has a direct band gap at Γ point in the Brillion Zone, and the effective masses of electrons are very greater than the effective mass of holes in this point.

@article{Sung2020,
abstract = {The performance of semiconductor devices is fundamentally governed by charge-carrier dynamics within the active materials1–6. Although advances have been made towards understanding these dynamics under steady-state conditions, the importance of non-equilibrium phenomena and their effect on device performances remains elusive7,8. In fact, the ballistic propagation of carriers is generally considered to not contribute to the mechanism of photovoltaics (PVs) and light-emitting diodes, as scattering rapidly disrupts such processes after carrier generation via photon absorption or electric injection9. Here we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers immediately after photon absorption in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy (fs-TAM) with a 10 fs temporal resolution and 10 nm spatial precision. We found that non-equilibrium carriers propagate ballistically over 150 nm within 20 fs of photon absorption. Our results suggest that in a typical perovskite PV device operating under standard conditions, a large fraction of carriers can reach the charge collection layers ballistically. The ballistic transport distance appears to be limited by energetic disorder within the materials, probably due to disorder-induced scattering. This provides a direct route towards optimization of the ballistic transport distance via improvements in materials and by minimizing the energetic disorder. Our observations reveal an unexplored regime of carrier transport in perovskites, which could have important consequences for device performance.},

abstract = {The unoccupied electronic structure of epitaxial Pb films on Si(1 1 1) is analyzed by angle-resolved two-photon photoemission in the $\Gamma$¯→M¯ direction close to the Brillouin zone center. The experimental results are compared to density functional theory calculations and we focus on the nature of the interaction of the 6pz states with the Si substrate. The experimentally obtained dispersion E(k||) of the unoccupied quantum well states is weaker than expected for freestanding films, in good agreement with their occupied counterparts. Following E(k||) of quantum well states as a function of momentum at different energies, which are degenerate and non-degenerate with the Si conduction band, we observe no influence of the Si bulk band and conclude a vanishing direct interaction of the Pb 6pz states with the Si band. However, the momentum range at which mixing of 6pz and 6px,y derived subbands is found to occur in the presence of the Si substrate is closer to $\Gamma$¯ than in the corresponding freestanding film, which indicates a substrate-mediated enhancement of the mixing of these states. Additional femtosecond time-resolved measurements show a constant relaxation time of hot electrons in unoccupied quantum well states as a function of parallel electron momentum which supports our conclusion of a px,y mediated interaction of the pz states with the Si conduction band.},

Herein, we present time- and spin-resolved photoemission results of spin injection from a laser-excited ferromagnet into a thin gold layer. The injected spin polarization is aligned along the magnetization direction of the underlying ferromagnet. Its decay time depends on the thickness of the gold layer, indicating that transport as well as storage of spins are relevant.

abstract = {Photo and particle induced charge carrier (electrons and holes) transport is studied in metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions of Ag-Al Ox -Al type. The electronic excitation induced by photo irradiation with h$\nu$=4.67 eV is compared with that induced by the impact of argon ions with a kinetic energy of 12 keV. The common feature of the two experiments is that only charge carriers with energies above (electrons) or below (holes) the tunnel barrier are detected. The electron to hole induced current ratio is adjustable by applying a bias voltage to the sample. A similar bias dependence of the induced current was found in both experiments. While the bias dependence of the photo induced current cannot be unambiguously explained due to the possibility of simultaneous excitation of both metal films, one can discuss the bias dependence of particle induced currents clearly in terms of electrons and holes excited in the top electrode only. Within a computer simulation based on a three dimensional model, we show that the photo induced conduction in Ag-Al Ox -Al junctions is mainly determined by the simultaneous excitation of electrons and holes in the top Ag film. Moreover, the model indicates that the dominant contribution to the induced current is given by the charge carriers excited near the silver-oxide interface. Finally, we show that the particle induced current can be modeled by carrier transport between two free-electron gases, excited to an elevated electron temperature and to room temperature, respectively. Hereby, the influence of the tunnel barrier parameters and the elevated electron temperature on the bias dependence is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

The linear magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and magneto-induced second harmonic (SH) generation (mSHG) have been utilized to study optically induced spin dynamics in highly excited state of matter with 20- femtosecond (fs) time resolution approaching the time scales of underlying elementary processes in metals. The spin transfer from a ferromagnet to a noble metal or from one ferromagnet to another one through a non-magnetic spacer by means of HC transport is of particular interest in this thesis. Investigation of these effects is of great impor- tance for understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and has a potentially high impact on future spintronic devices. Epitaxial Au/Fe/MgO(001) and Fe/Au/Fe/MgO(001) structures have been used as basic model systems, where in the latter case one Fe layer serves as a spin-emitter and another Fe layer serves as a spin-collector. As a first step towards understanding of the spin transfer in metallic MLs, HC transport has been investigated in simpler two-layer Au/Fe/MgO(001) structures. It has been shown that pumping the Fe film through a transparent MgO substrate leads to the generation of a spin current (SC) flowing from the ferromagnetic film into the non-magnetic layer. This phenomenon is an analog of the spin Seebeck effect, but in this case the SC is dominated by non-equilibrium (NEQ) HCs propagating in Au in a quasi-ballistic regime. According to the first principle quantum transport calculation, the emission of majority electrons from the Fe film into the Au layer is much more efficient than the emission of other HCs, which provides a net flux of the positive SP into the bulk of Au. Quantitative analysis of the MOKE signals, measured from the Fe side of Au/Fe/MgO(001) structures with different Fe thicknesses, reveals a considerable contribution of the HC transport to ultrafast demagnetization of the Fe film, followed by a build-up of transient magnetization in the Au layer which also contributes to the MOKE signal. Finally, magnetization dynamics induced in a ferromagnet by the injection of the spin-polarized HCs has been studied on three-layer Fe/Au/Fe/MgO(001) structures. Owing to different coercitivities of the Fe films, the magnetizations in the spin-emitter and the spin-collector can be aligned parallel, antiparallel or orthogonal to each other. For the orthogonal alignment, it has been demonstrated that the optically-driven SC pulse excites standing spin waves in the spin-collector via the spatially non-uniform spin transfer torque (STT) mechanism. Realization of different mutual orientations of the external magnetic field and the magnetizations in the spin-emitter and the spin-collector makes it possible to disentangle STT from laser-induced heating of the sample. Moreover, in the analysis of the mSHG response measured in different mag- netic geometries it has been undoubtedly proven that the SC pulse gives rise to the SH field originating in the bulk. All data are in a good agreement with the experimental results obtained on two-layer structures and sustains the model of spin-polarized HC transport.},

abstract = {Time-resolved two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy is used to study the dynamics of non-equilibrium electron and hole distributions at bare and D 2O-covered Ru(001) following optical excitation (55-fs, 800-nm pulses) with variable fluence (0.04-0.6 mJ cm-2). Within the first 0.5 ps we observe an ultra-fast transient of the excited-carrier population and energy density at the surface which is accompanied by pronounced deviations of the electron-energy distribution from a (thermalized) Fermi-Dirac distribution. Comparison of the transient energy density of the photo-excited electrons at the surface with predictions of the two-temperature model provides fair agreement up to 400 fs, but exhibits a systematically lower energy density at later times, where electrons and phonons are equilibrated. We propose that this reduced energy density at the surface originates from ultra-fast energy transport of non-thermal electrons into the bulk in competition to electron-phonon coupling at the surface. This is corroborated by extending the two-temperature model to account for non-thermal, photo-excited electrons, whereby quantitative agreement with experiment can only be achieved if ballistic transport and reduced electron-phonon coupling is incorporated for non-thermal electrons. Implications for surface femtochemistry are discussed.},

@article{Hohlfeld2000,
abstract = {New results about relaxation dynamics of optically excited electrons in metals, mostly gold and nickel films, are presented. Emphasis is on electron temperature near the surface as well as on the range of energy transport by ballistic and diffusive electron motion in comparison to the optical penetration depth. The experiments focus on the interval between creation of an electron temperature and the time at which thermal equilibrium between electrons and lattice is reached. Results were obtained by time-resolved linear and second-harmonic reflectivity measurements carried out in pump-probe mode. It is shown that the two-temperature model is well suited to describe hot electron diffusion in metals and to extract electron-phonon coupling constants from experimental data, provided corrections for ballistic electron motion are incorporated. The electron-phonon coupling constant of gold was found to be independent of film thickness down to 10 nm. For noble metals, probe reflectivities near the interband transition were related to electron temperatures by a proper model for the dielectric function. For transition metals such relation between reflectivity and electron temperature is more difficult. A new pump-pump-probe technique was introduced which allows to study hot electron relaxation by probing the reflectivity in thermal equilibrium between electrons and lattice. Also these results can be well described by the two-temperature model. Finally, the interface sensitivity of the second harmonic was utilized to detect vibrational motion and thermal expansion of ultrathin nickel films on Cu(001).},

@article{Battiato2012,
abstract = {Femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnetic material creates energetic spin-polarized electrons that have anomalous transport characteristics. We develop a semiclassical theory that is specifically dedicated to capture the transport of laser-excited nonequilibrium (NEQ) electrons. The randomly occurring multiple electronic collisions, which give rise to electron thermalization, are treated exactly and we include the generation of electron cascades due to inelastic electron-electron scatterings. The developed theory can, moreover, treat the presence of several different layers in the laser-irradiated material. The derived spin-dependent transport equation is solved numerically and it is shown that the hot NEQ electron spin transport occurs neither in the diffusive nor ballistic regime, it is superdiffusive. As the excited spin majority and minority electrons in typical transition-metal ferromagnets (e.g., Fe, Ni) have distinct, energy-dependent lifetimes, fast spin dynamics in the femtosecond (fs) regime is generated, causing effectively a spin current. As examples, we solve the resulting spin dynamics numerically for typical heterostructures, specifically, a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic metallic layered junction (i.e., Fe/Al and Ni/Al) and a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic insulator junction (Fe or Ni layer on a large band-gap insulator as, e.g., MgO). For the ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic metallic junction where the ferromagnetic layer is laser-excited, the computed spin dynamics shows that injection of a superdiffusive spin current in the nonmagnetic layer (Al) is achieved. The injected spin current consists of screened NEQ, mobile majority-spin electrons and is nearly 90{\%} spin-polarized for Ni and about 65{\%} for Fe. Concomitantly, a fast demagnetization of the ferromagnetic polarization in the femtosecond regime is driven. The analogy of the generated spin current to a superdiffusive spin Seebeck effect is surveyed. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},
